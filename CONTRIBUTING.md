# Contributing to openBF

Following there is a set of guidelins for contributing to openBF development. Feel free to propose changes to this document via a pull request.

## How can I contribute?

### Reporting bugs
- Check the [open issues](https://github.com/INSIGNEO/openBF/issues) to avoid duplicates
- Ensure you are using the latest Julia version compatible with openBF; currently, this is the 0.6.0
- Open a bug report (see [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) for a _good_ bug report template) OR try to fix it and make a pull request

### Suggest Enhancements
Currently, openBF is in active development and new features will be added in the future. We keep track of the additions in our [roadmap](https://github.com/INSIGNEO/openBF/issues/6). Feel free to suggest more enhancements through the issues tracker.

### New vascular networks
We collect vascular networks in a separate repository, [openBF-hub](https://github.com/alemelis/openBF-hub). If you have used openBF to analyse a new network, please make a pull request to the hub so that we can keep expanding our model repository.
