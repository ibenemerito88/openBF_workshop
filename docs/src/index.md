# openBF

openBF is a computational library written in [Julia](https://insigneo.github.io/openBF/Docs/doc-files/julialang.org) for blood flow simulations in straight elastic arteries. Navier-Stokes equations are reduced to 1D form and solved along the longitudinal direction. The numerical solution is achieved via MUSCL, a second-order finite-volume scheme. A detailed description of the numerical scheme is given in
